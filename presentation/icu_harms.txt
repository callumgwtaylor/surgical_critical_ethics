# Harms of ICU

## Quality of Life

Previous Surveys Survivors:
Problems with physical/psychological/social health: 2/3 of all 
Requiring significant care from family members in first year after discharge: 1/3 of all

This Survey:
2/3 patients were lost to follow up by the 1 year point
This is all patients who needed more than 48hrs of care
So you could 

Measure | Before ICU | After ICU
---|---|---
Employed | 40% |
Retired | 46% |
Unemployed | 6% |
Long Term Sick | 6% |

Negative Effect on employment = Unemployed, Early Retirement, Part Time, Long Term Sick = ~1/3 at 6 months ~just under 1/3 at 12 months

Requiring assistance with assistance of daily living = 1/4 at at 6 months, 1/5 at 1 year (Majority of this is from family members)

Half of family members providing care had to make adjustment to their working life.
1/4 of families providing care had to spend savings/borrow money/sell their house, to pay for care

Measures of quality of life = no significant difference

The amount of people who need help with mobility had doubled (to about half of patients)

Half of patients had been in mod/extreme pain before admission, this had increased to 70% at 12 months.
1/3 patients had mod/extreme depression before admission, this had increased to just under 1/2 patients at 12 months (44%). So this means, if you didn't have depression before, you had ~1/6 chance of being depressed after. And if you were depressed before you will be depressed after.

The overall scores in QoL in all measures of quality of life were lower than compared to the UK normal population.

HR-QoL marked reduction at 12 months

What increases the risk of that, the same authors looked at risk factors, and higher comorbidity count seemed to have the greatest risk. [@Griffiths2018]

## During ICU

- Noise
- Light
- Bed
- Sleep Deprivation
- Thirst
- Hunger
- Temperature
- Pain ~70% of ICU Patients experience this
	+ Venepuncture
	+ Catheterisation
	+ Airway Management
	+ Laryngoscopy/Bronchoscopy
	+ NG insertion
	+ Chest Drain
	+ X Rays
	+ Turning
	+ Dressing Change
- Lines
- Lack of Priivacy
- Anxiety
- Isolation

After discharge, half of patients describe discomfort being in ICU [@Leur2004]

- ETT
- Hallucinations
- Medical Activity
- Noise/No Rest
- Pain
- Thirst
- Unable to talk
- Shortness of breath
- Being Afraid

Other studies only half of patients recall these events at all. So it maybe that more are in discomfort, it's just half that remember. [@Leur2004]  Patients with better factual recollection had greater recollection of discomfort.

## Death

- 1/3 family members have PTSD after admission
- ~1/2 family members have complicated grief reaction
