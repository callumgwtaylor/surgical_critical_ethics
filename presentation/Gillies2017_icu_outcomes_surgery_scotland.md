# ICU Outcomes after High-Risk Surgery

The way someone is admitted to intensive care affects mortality, planned admissions after surgery are less likely to be as sick on admission and less likely to die than those admitted "indirectly"

Of all patients admitted to hospital in this data set, 1% died before discharge home. 10% died by end of 4 year follow up period. This was all surgical inpatients, all patients receiving an operation (with exceptions of: cardiac, neurosurgical, patients receiving endoscopy, organ transplant, obstetrics, surgical management of burns). If they had more than one procedure in the 3 years only that first one was assesed.

[This cohort of surgical patients appears more well than the overall hospital admission cohort. If 35% of patients are in their last year of life when we look at all admissions, and this cohort had only 10% mortality at 4 years. But of course, the fact that it only looks at the first procedure does mess with this a bit.]

The authors found that in total 6.4% of post operative patients were admitted to intensive care in scotland. 3/4 of ICU admissions were directly from theatre, 1/4 were admitted indirectly.
Those admitted directly were more likely to be older or having more significant surgery.
Patients admitted to ICU indirectly were generally sicker, with higher mortality, longer ICU stay, greater need for ventilation/organ support.
