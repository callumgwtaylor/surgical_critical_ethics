    <h1 class="title">Shared Ethical Dilemmas For Surgery and Critical Care</h1>
    <h2 class="author">Callum Taylor</h2>

</section>

<section id="introduction" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<aside class="notes">
<p>This is the title I was provided, shared ethical dilemmas for surgery and critical care. It’s important to be honest from the start and say that this talk won’t be like the other talks in that it provides no answers as to what to do.</p>
<p>The point of a dilemma, what makes a dilemma a dilemma is that you find yourself in a situation where there are at least two reasonable arguments, to take two completely different courses of action. When it comes to a medical ethical dilemma that is shared by the surgical team and those of us working in critical care, the clearest example would be ethical dilemmas faced when treating the critically unwell surgical patient.</p>
<p>This talk is going to focus on the dilemma that all of us regardless of our level of experience have faced, approaching the situation where we try and weigh up reasons to continue, or reasons to stop certain hospital treatments, ones you may consider in an attempt to preserve someones’ life.</p>
<p>As I said, I’m not going to give any answer here. My aim is to put forward an argument that they only way these decisions can be made with the greatest likelihood of doing what’s best for an individual patient, is through discussion with them, with detail that we might find uncomfortable to provide. I’m also going to argue that as the professionals who know your patients best, you as surgeons are in the strongest position to have helpful and meaningful conversations with your patients to plan what’s best for them.</p>
<p>In this talk I will explain that I think the main dilemma for surgeons and clinicians is to work out when to continue with life sustaining treatment and when to stop.</p>
<p>I want to put that I think that a major source of difficulty for us is not knowing what’s for the best for the patient. I can then put that there is an easy way for us to have a better idea about what’s best for that patient, and that’s by talking to them about it. However talking to them about it only works if we come at it from the same understanding, from the shared common language.</p>
<p>I’ll explain what my general understanding I think a patient should know to help make a decision.</p>
<p>I’ll explain what I think we need to know about our patients to help us make our decisions.</p>
<p>I’ll explain how we can use the ethical principles to lay out our argument And I’ll explain why I don’t think they’re set in stone.</p>
<p>I’ll talk a bit about proportional discussion based decisions.</p>
<p>And a tiny bit about the law.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>So this is the first point that I’d like to bring. The patients that we meet are more likely to be close to the end of their life than we think. These statistics are from FICM’s Working Group on End of Life care. 35% of inpatients in hospital are in their last year of life. Now of course that includes all patients, and doesn’t quite hit the population we are considering for surgery and intensive care. But of those who do go to ICU, one in five of them don’t survive hospital. Of those who do survive to get home, one in five of them are dead within the year. And these two points are of the patients who we’ve already thought are “well enough” for ICU.</p>

<p>Stop means a lot of things. It might mean, when do we withdraw invasive ventilation, stop inotropes, stop dialysis. It might mean, when do we say we shouldn’t start those things, or escalate the amount we are giving. It might mean, when do we say we shouldn’t go to theatre. Or that we limit our invasive approach in theatre, we’d fix one thing if we found it, we wouldn’t do another, we would not support in critical care after theatre.</p>
<p>To consider stopping, in whatever definition we’ve gone for, is to recognise that there is a balance to be made with all medical and surgical treatments. Dunstan describes it as the competing duties to protect the rights to a good life and a good death.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>We can expand out this idea, we can approach intervention as allowing us to hit one of four options: A Good Life, A Bad Life, A Good Death, A Bad Death</p>
<p>Every intervention can affect the likelihood of which outcome we hit.</p>
<p>Some of those can be seen as desirable, and some of those undesirable.</p>
<p>The definition of what makes a life good or not is uncertain. The definition of what makes a death good or not is uncertain.</p>
<p>How desirable they are is uncertain. Whether they are desirable at all or important at all is uncertain.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>What we’re getting at though, is that there is, at some unknown point, a tipping point for an intervention for a patient, that switches what we’re doing into something that is likely enough to give them an outcome they desire, into not giving a good enough chance at an outcome they desire, and maybe also giving them too high a chance at an outcome they don’t want.</p>

<p>The classic way any attempt to work out the right thing to do it to split it up into, is it the outcome of the action that’s important, or is it the reasons we took that action that are what makes an action right or wrong.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to split this up. The most common form of a consequentialist approach seen, particularly in medicine, is to judge an act based on how much of a certain outcome it creates. The traditional way to do that is to say act in a way that creates the most happiness. Happiness is pretty much the same thing as the concept known as utility, which is where you get the idea of utilitarianism. The right thing to do is the one that maximises utility, or happiness. You can switch in any other outcome into here, so we can change our important outcome from happiness to lives saved. The right way to act is the way that will save the most lives.</p>
<p>We can then say that because we don’t know for certain what is the outcome when we act, we only know how likely we guess an outcome will be, rather than talking about pure utility, we should talk about <em>expected utility</em>. When you are taking an expected utilitarian approach, you are saying the way to judge if an act is right or wrong, is by seeing if the act is the one that is most likely to give us the outcome we care about.</p>
<p>There are some problems that come up with this expected utilitarian approach. Firstly, it says the only thing that matters is how likely it is that someone survives, and what you do to achieve that goal is not important. Secondly, the only right approach is the one that is most likely to get the outcome you want. An alternative action, one that’s pretty likely to give the outcome you want, but not as likely, is considered to be the ethically wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>If you say this is rubbish, that the ends don’t justify the means, that it’s the reasons you act that are important, rather than the outcome of your actions, then you’re taking a non-consequential, or deoontological approach. That might be any manner of approach, it might be that you think the most important thing is to respect someones humans rights, or to treat people with compassion, or to act in a way you think a good doctor would act (whatever that is). This may be a lot more nuanced, than just the looking at whether someone survives or dies. The difficulty here, is that if you’re a strict non-consequentialist, then whether someone lives or dies does not affect whether an action is good or bad, or better or worse.</p>
<p>So, at this point, you might think like me, that both these approaches seem rubbish. You can’t say only the outcomes matter and not the reasons you took an action. You also can’t say in any situation there is only one acceptable action. You also cant say only the reasons matter and the consequences dont. Instead, if you look at our dilemma as it started, we think both the outcome of an action, and the reasons for an action are important.</p>

<h1>Principlism</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Autonomy</em> - Respecting the person as a person with their own rights</li>
<li><em>Justice</em> - Treat people fairly</li>
<li><em>Beneficence</em> - Do good</li>
<li><em>Non-Maleficence</em> - Dont do bad</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>This is where alternative systems come into play. This is where we can talk about the approach you’ve probably been told is THE way to approach ethical dilemmas in medicine, the idea of principlism.</p>
<p>Principlism is a way of approaching ethical dilemmas in medicine, it allows you to take into account both outcomes and values.</p>
<p>We can see how taking a principlist approach allows us to take a more wideranging approach. Principlism says there’s more than one approach to working out what’s right and wrong. It’s called a pluralist approach as it takes on a plurality of reasons. Classically the other systems I’d already described would be seen as absolutist, in that there’s only one thing that decides if an outcome is right or wrong, and that thing is ABSOLUTE.</p>
<p>Whereas here in pluralism we can say that it’s important to act in a way that save’s someones life, that’s maximising beneficence. But also you’re respecting that person’s human rights, that’s maximising autonomy. You are also trying to avoid causing them pain, causing them suffering, in that maximising non-maleficence way.</p>

<section id="the-law" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>The Law</h1>
<ul>
<li>Statute</li>
<li>Case Law</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>The way the law works in the UK, is we can split it into two main groups of decisions. You’ve got statute, the acts of parliament. Here in Glasgow, you’ve two sets of laws that come into play, there’s the ones that are UK wide, and there are ones that are Scotland specific. So an example would be the Human Rights Act, that’s UK wide, and then the Adults with Incapacity Act, that’s Scotland specific (England and Wales’ version being the Mental Capacity Act).</p>
<p>These acts, this statute, can be pretty specific. The adults with incapacity act explains a set of tests that you would need to perform to determine whether someone makes decisions for themselves. They can also though be pretty vague. The human rights act establishs a set of right’s that you are legally entitled to have protected. When statute needs specified though, that’s where the courts come into play. Working out how to apply statute is the role of the courts, the role of the judiciary. If there are questions about say, how should we act legally in a way that protects someones Article 2 Right To Life, but also doesn’t impede their Article 3 Right to be free from inhuman or degrading treatment, that’s for the courts to establish.</p>

<section id="the-law-and-our-dilemma" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>The Law And Our Dilemma</h1>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a legal right to life?</li>
<li>Do you have a legal right to a good life?</li>
<li>Do you have a legal right to death, or a good death?
<ul>
<li>Is death legally allowed?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>These questions seem to get a bit daft towards the end, are people legally allowed to die? The reason I put that is that you can say clearly that people have a legal right to life, you can point at Article 2 of the Human Rights Act. You can point at the right to a good life by pointing at various bits of legislation, depending on what you decide a good life means. But there’s Article 3 saying you shouldn’t be subjected to torture, Article 4 protecting you from slavery, Article 5 protecting your right to liberty, and Article 8 protecting your right to a private life, and Article 14 protecting you from discrimination.</p>
<p>There is not an equivalent to this when it comes to death. The reason I’ve been told, is that if you’ve a right to death established in law, or a right to a good death established in law, then it opens state bodies up to being brought to courts to allow for things like physician assisted suicide, or euthanasia. If we aren’t offering things like this we might be infringing on a right to a good death.</p>
<p>When we look at case law though, we can see, it is OK for people to die. It is allowed. People can legally refuse treatments in full knowledge that they will die without them. Physicians can act in ways that may hasten someone’s death, as long as they were doing so for a different purpose then simply speeding up a death (such as stopping a treatment that is causing suffering, or starting a treatment that will relieve suffering).</p>
<p>An example of this would be what drily gets called Airedale vs Bland. This is a case that clearly demonstrates in UK law the ability to withdraw care that is keeping someone alive in a persistent vegetative state, even without their consent or advance directive. Tony Bland was ayoung man critically injured in the Hillsborough football disaster, and the case was establishing the right to withdraw artificial nutrition and hydration that was keeping him alive in a persistent vegetative state.</p>

<p>So Back To The Dilemma. We’re looking here at the question of when is enough intervention enough? Which of the outcomes do we think our intervention will result in, a good life or bad life, a good death or bad death. Are the chances of any of these unacceptably high or unacceptably low? We’ve got a bit more knowledge now to adjust the chances of these.</p>

<p>The patient lacks mental capacity to decide, so treatment would be on a best interests basis. His expressed, but non-capacitous, wish is against medical intervention. Tracheostomy was considered to avoid impending acute airway obstruction, to allow acute medical treatment, assessment and possible resolution of mental illness, and time for work-up and consideration of definitive cancer treatment. Family were keen to preserve his life, but not at any cost Family’s primary concern was to avoid distress and respect patient’s previously discussed wishes.</p>

<p>Outcome Following discussion of options, the pros and cons of each, and the beliefs and priorities that the patient would have brought to the decision, it was agreed not to proceed with tracheostomy insertion, and instead to treat any distress with palliative drugs, including ‘rescue midazolam’ in the case of acute airway obstruction. Transferred to a hospice. He became gradually weaker and although his stridor worsened, he died peacefully on day 19, without acute airway obstruction.</p>
