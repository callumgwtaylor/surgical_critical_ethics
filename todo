# Surgical Ethics Course

What I need to do here is focus on the content, and not on the presentation

I should write the script of the talk, and then afterwards work outr how I will present it.

I spend too long focusing on the way to present it with clever techniques in reveal.js. That is important but it is the dicking about at the end. The most important thing is the actual content of the talk.

This is a half hour talk on the ethical dilemmas in intensive care.

The greatest dilemma is when do we stop.


## What Am I trying To Teach

1. What the dilemma is
    - Why is it a dilemma
2. Ethical Structures That Can Explain The Dilemma
3. Medical Evidence That Might Support This Description
4. A Method To Approach This
